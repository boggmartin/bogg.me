						<p>
						A cautious adventurer, eager to push the boundaries while maintaining a solid foundation. I dream of the future and the things that we can create together as a society. At the same time, I’m mindful of the present. We all have our different needs, preconceptions and perspectives that impacts our behaviors and sometimes prevent change. I prefer to understand people rather than judge or force change. I'm believe that change comes from within and growth can’t be forced. I want to push ahead while maintaining my connection with the present.
						<br><br>
						My interest in environmental issues is older than I can remember. It is something that I grew up with. Especially climate-related issues have interested me for a long time. It probably appealed to the analytic side of me. During military service in Afghanistan in my early twenties, I found a growing interest in social issues. I associate this experience with the growth of my empathic side. Since then my interest in social issues, human behavior and emotions have grown. This have been enriching for me personally and widened my perspectives on society, environment, leadership, technology and much more.
						<br><br>
						The tragic loss of my brother in 2016 have impacted me in many ways. Since then I have experienced chock, grief, anger, hopelessness, resistance and a breakdown. It took me almost two years to recover to a balanced and creative mindset. I exit this phase with new perspectives on life. I am more aware of what truly matters to me and I want to spend my life doing things for the right reasons.
						<br><br>
						I want to be a good role-model and truly live my values. To me, being a good role model includes being true to my values and my cause. It means enjoying pleasures in life. It means being open with my perspectives, feelings and intentions even when it feels uncomfortable. Sometimes these elements go together, other times they are in opposition. As a good role model, it’s important to find a balance.
