						<p>A cautious adventurer, eager to push the boundaries while maintaining a solid foundation. Human history contains a string of radical changes performed to adapt to new conditions. This excites me and I want to be a part of the radical changes needed to take human civilization to the next level to avoid social and environmental collapse. At the same time, I’m mindful of peoples current needs, motives and perspectives and I want to meet every person on their terms. Rather than blaming and judging those who don’t agree, I try to understand.
						<br><br>
						My interest in environmental issues is older than I can remember. It is probably something that I grew up with. Especially climate-related issues interested me. It was probably appealing to the analytic side of me. During military service in Afghanistan in my early twenties, I found a growing interest in social issues. I associate this experience with the growth of my empathic side. Since then my interest in social issues, human behaviour and emotions have grown. This have been enriching for me personally and widened my perspectives on society, environment, leadership, technology and much more.
						<br><br>
						The tragic loss of my brother in 2016 have impacted me in many ways. Since then I have experienced chock, grief, anger, hopelessness, resistance and a breakdown. It took me almost two years to recover to the point that I am today. Luckily, I feel happy and creative once again. I exit this phase of my life with new perspectives on life. I am more aware of what truly matters to me and I want to spend my life doing things for the right reasons.
						<br><br>
						I want to be a good role-model and truly live my values. To me, being a good role model includes being true to my values and my cause. It means enjoying pleasures in life. It means being open with my perspectives, feelings and intentions even when it feels uncomfortable. Sometimes these elements go together, other times they are in opposition. As a good role model, It is important to find a balance.
